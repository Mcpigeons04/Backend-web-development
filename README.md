<h2>Welcome!</h2>h
This project aims to enable us to connect the MongoDB database to the backend server, here the data is sent through the postman and the data gets stored in MongoDB.
Here, we have register and login function where if the user is new then the user will have to register, here we will get the data of the new user if he/she registers!!
If the user is already an existing user, then he will be required to login using password
Here I have implemented the authentication and authorization for the user if he logs in successfully! The Postman is used for GET request and we can check for the login Credentials.
<h6>This project is built using MongoDB, Nodejs, and Expressjs techs</h6>
